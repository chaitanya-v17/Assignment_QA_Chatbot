# AI-Powered Document QA Agent

This project implements an AI-powered agent-based application using Streamlit, LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS. It allows users to upload PDF documents and ask natural language questions based on the document's content. The application leverages a LangChain agent to provide accurate answers by processing the document, creating embeddings, and using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Easily upload PDF documents through a clean Streamlit interface.
- **Natural Language Questions**: Ask questions about the uploaded document in plain English.
- **AI-Powered Answers**: Get accurate answers generated by an OpenAI LLM, powered by LangChain.
- **Vector Database**: Uses FAISS for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
- **Modular Design**: Code is organized into separate modules for UI, document processing, embeddings, and agent setup.
- **Verbose Agent (ReAct style)**: The agent's reasoning process is displayed step-by-step, providing transparency.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

1.  **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application file, handling the UI and orchestrating the flow.
2.  **`src/document_processor.py`**: Contains functions for loading PDF documents, splitting them into chunks, generating OpenAI embeddings, and storing/loading them in a FAISS vector database.
3.  **`src/agent_setup.py`**: Responsible for setting up the LangChain agent, defining the tools it can use (in this case, a document QA tool), and initializing the LLM.
4.  **`src/utils.py`**: Provides utility functions, such as loading environment variables (e.g., OpenAI API key).
5.  **`.env`**: Stores sensitive information like the OpenAI API key.
6.  **`data/`**: Directory to temporarily store uploaded PDF files.
7.  **`faiss_index/`**: Directory where the FAISS vector store is saved.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-document-qa-agent.git
cd ai-document-qa-agent
```

*(Note: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/ai-document-qa-agent.git` with the actual repository URL if this project is hosted on GitHub.)*

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

-   **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
-   **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set up OpenAI API Key

1.  Rename `example.env` to `.env` (if it exists, otherwise create a new `.env` file).
2.  Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual OpenAI API key. You can obtain one from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### 6. Run the Streamlit Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

1.  **Upload a PDF**: On the left sidebar, click "Browse files" to upload a PDF document.
2.  **Wait for Processing**: The application will process the PDF, chunk its content, create embeddings, and set up the AI agent. A success message will appear once ready.
3.  **Ask Questions**: In the main content area, type your question related to the document in the text input box and press Enter.
4.  **View Answer**: The AI agent will process your question and display the answer, along with its reasoning steps (if verbose mode is enabled).

## Sample PDFs

You can place sample PDF documents in the `data/` directory to test the application.

## Troubleshooting

-   **`OPENAI_API_KEY not found` error**: Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up with your API key and is in the root directory of the project.
-   **Dependencies issues**: Make sure all packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.
-   **PDF processing errors**: Ensure the uploaded file is a valid PDF.
